## Problem Statement

   The objective of this task is to load and explore a structured dataset using Pandas, perform essential data inspection and cleaning operations, and apply NumPy for numerical 
analysis. Using the Student Performance dataset, the task aims to understand dataset structure, ensure data quality, and extract basic statistical insights from numerical 
features.


## Dataset Description

    The Student Performance dataset contains academic and demographic information of students and is commonly used to analyze factors influencing educational outcomes. 
The dataset includes categorical features such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course, along with numerical features representing scores 
in mathematics, reading, and writing. The target of analysis is not predictive in this task but exploratory, focusing on understanding score distributions and overall dataset 
quality. The dataset is structured, well-labeled, and suitable for foundational data handling and statistical analysis.


## Conclusion

    In this task, we successfully loaded and explored the Student Performance dataset using Pandas. The dataset was inspected for structure, data types, missing values, and 
duplicates. No significant data quality issues were found. NumPy was used to perform statistical analysis on students’ math scores, providing insights into average performance, 
score distribution, and variability. This task strengthened foundational skills in data handling, cleaning, and numerical analysis.
